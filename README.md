# traffic-alarm

## Rationale

Python Tkinter silent alarm to give kids a green light to wake up (or a red light to go back to sleep). My wife was telling me about an alarm clock that looks like a traffic light. Instead of buzzing to wake in the morning, the green light turns on.  The idea is that instead of your kid coming into your bedroom to ask if they can wake up yet, they can just look at the light to see if they should wake up or not. This is especially helpful for ages < ~4 when clock reading skills are not advanced enough to help them decide if they should be getting up yet. My boy has the traffic light concept down pat though ("Red means stop! ... Green GO!").

## Usage

- Just set the bed and wake times and hit submit.
- Tested with Python 2.7

## Future Development

- I'm waffling (breakfast/morning pun intending) between adding a clock and keeping it simple.  A clock would really only be for me or my wife at this point, and would take away from its simplicity.
- Change the window to fullscreen
