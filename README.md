# traffic-alarm

## Rationale

Silent alarm to give kids a green light to wake up (or a red light to go back to sleep). My wife was telling me about an alarm clock that looks like a traffic light. We don't need an alarm to wake up our son if he is sleeping, so instead of buzzing to wake in the morning, the green light turns on.  The idea is that instead of your kid coming into your bedroom to ask if they can wake up yet, they can just look at the light to see if they should wake up or not. This is especially helpful for ages < ~4 when clock reading skills are not advanced enough to help them decide if they should be getting up yet. My boy has the traffic light concept down pat though ("Red means stop! ... Green GO!").

## Usage

- Just set the bed and wake times and hit submit.
- Tested with Python 2.7 for the Tkinter version
- Offline web app designed for IOS
    1. Host on a server of your choice
    2. Navigate to server address
    3. Save site to homescreen
    + All files needed will be automatically cached so you don't need access to the server after the first time.

## Future Development

- Change the window to fullscreen for the Tkinter version
